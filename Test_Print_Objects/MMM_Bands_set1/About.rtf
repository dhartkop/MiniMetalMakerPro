These bands are designed to be printed in BRONZEpaste3D metal clay using the Mini Metal Maker. 3D printing with metal clay provides an easy and accurate way to produce ring sizes as you need them for your jewelry making needs. These ring objects are created oversized by 10% to compensate for clay shrinkage during the firing process.\
